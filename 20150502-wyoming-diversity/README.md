Change in Black Population

"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States, States, and Counties: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013" (Released June 2014)

In this dataset, we use each state's black population from 2010 and 2013 to determine the percent change in the black population between 2010 and 2013. 

We also include each state's total population for those years. 

Under 10 Population - Wyoming

"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013" (Released June 2014)

Though we do not provide a graph of this dataset, we did use it to make inferences about the state's growing number of non-white children. Based on these data, we are able to say that between 2010 and 2013, the number of black children under age 10 increased by over 40 percent.
