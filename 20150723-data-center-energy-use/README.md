### Where does this data come from?

**Sources for data center electricity use:**

Data center electricity use figures are estimates based on research and modeling by Jonathan Koomey, research fellow at Stanford University focusing on data centers.
U.S. Electricity Consumption Source: [Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov/beta/MER/index.cfm?tbl=T07.01#/?f=A&start=200001)
Data Center Electricity Consumption Sources: 2000 and 2005, [Koomey](http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html); 2011 and 2013 are NRDC estimates based on [Koomey](http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/data-center-efficiency-assessment-IP.pdf)
