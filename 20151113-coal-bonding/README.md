# U.S. Coal Bonding
Basic data about clean-up/reclamation obligations (bonding) for the top 10 U.S. coal-producing states, including: current bond amounts and portion that are self-bonded, 2014 coal production, state bonding laws, acres disturbed from coal mining.

## What's in this repository?

This repository includes the data used for the graphics in the Inside Energy story, ["In Coal Country, No Cash In Hand For Billions In Cleanup"](http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/14/in-coal-county-no-cash-in-hand-for-billions-in-cleanup/).

## Data dictionary

The data files *2015-coal-bonding-obligations.csv* and *2015-coal-bonding-obligations.xlsx* include the following information, as of November, 2015, for the top 10 U.S. coal-producing states:
* *State* is the two-letter postal code
* *Coal Production Rank 2014*
* *Self Bonds ($)* is the dollar amount for the current/active bond obligations (as of November 2015) that are self bonds
* *Other Bonds ($)* is the dollar amount for the current/active bond obligations (as of November 2015) that are other bond types (letters of credit, cash, etc.) 
* *Allows Self Bonding?* is a y/n value indicating whether or not the state accepts self bonds
* *Percent Self Bonds*

The data files *2014-coal-acres-disturbed.csv* and *2014-coal-acres-disturbed.xlsx* include the following information for the top 10 U.S. coal-producing states:
* *State* is the two-letter postal code
* *Acreage Disturbed (2014 year start)* is the number of acres in permited areas disturbed by surface coal mining and reclamation
* *Acreage Disturbed (2014 year end)*

The data files *2014-state-coal-production.csv* and *2014-state-coal-production.xlsx* include the following information for all U.S. coal-producing states:
* *State* is the state name
* *2014 Total Coal Production (tons)*

## Data Sources

Data on current bonding obligations are from the departments of environmental quality in each state. For a list of the names of those departments, go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZGn_p13HjPsiCWNc9dGlIwGo1kI1Wi96ojSj1gSg7g/edit#gid=502410292).

Data on disturbed acres is from the annual evaluation reports published by the OSMRE, downloaded from [http://www.odocs.osmre.gov/](http://www.odocs.osmre.gov/). "Disturbed Area" is from Table 6, "Areas of Permits Disturbed by Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation," given in acres at year start and year end, 2014.

Data on coal production is from the Energy Information Administration.

## Notes

After initially publishing this chart, West Virginia contacted us to let us know they originally sent bond obligations for active mines, as opposed to active bonds (which could apply to mines where mining operations had stopped but clean-up and reclamation activities continue). West Virginia has provided us with the appropriate data, and we have updated it in the tables here and in the chart in the original article.
