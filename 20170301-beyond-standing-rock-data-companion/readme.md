# A Data Companion to *Beyond Standing Rock*

"A Data Companion to *Beyond Standing Rock*" illuminates the intersection of geography, energy development and tribal sovereignty in the United States through a series of maps. 

In this repository, you’ll find information about the data sources, relevant notes about the data, and links to downloads of the shape files (where available). You’ll also find a PDF version of the printable data companion, as well as standalone images of each of the data vignettes.

## How to print and fold your own map booklet
1. Download the [BSR-data-companion.pdf](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/Data-for-stories/raw/master/20170301-beyond-standing-rock-data-companion/BSR-data-companion.pdf) file - warning, it's 48 MB, so a bit large!
2. The maps work best when printed in full color on 11”x17” paper/tabloid size (you can also scale to 8 ½”x11” paper)
3. Print the map using a double-sided setting
4. First, fold long-wise, with the “Beyond Standing Rock” cover on the outside
5. Next, fold short-wise, again keeping the cover on the outside
6. Enjoy!

## National map: Tribal lands and fossil fuel reserves

### Data source for historical map:
* Shape files of **historical Indian lands** are from Claudio Saunt of the University of Georgia, adapted from the ehistory.org project, [“The Invasion of America”](http://invasionofamerica.ehistory.org/) and used with permission. View an interactive map of the tribal lands over time here, or a video here.

### Data sources for present-day map:
* **Indian reservations and areas** are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s TIGER/Line files, [American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Areas](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2016&layergroup=American+Indian+Area+Geography), 2016. These are the legal and statistical areas for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data, and are outlined in detail [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_aiannha.html). Note that these include reservations as well as other types of designated tribal areas, such as the Tribal Statistical Areas in Oklahoma, which are the site of a former reservation. This does not show land ownership (which can vary within these geographies) or mineral rights. Ownership and management of lands and natural resources are a complex patchwork, as you can see in the Southern Ute map.
* **Coal fields** of the U.S. data is from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). More information is available [here](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/of96-092/arcview_files/) and you can download PDF version of the coal fields map [here](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/of96-092/other_files/us_coal.pdf).
* **U.S. tight oil shale and gas plays** (for the lower 48 states) data is from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.php).
* **Alaska oil and gas areas** are from the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas, statewide area sale boundaries, available [here](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/GIS/GISDataFiles.htm)  
* **State boundaries** are from U.S. Census Bureau, available [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html). We used 20m resolution, updated in 2015.

## Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access
### Data Sources
* **Waterways** are from USGS, available [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-streams-and-waterbodies-of-the-united-states-200512-shapefile)
* **Satellite imagery** is LANDSAT 8, accessed via [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), from NASA/USGS. The image is from September, 2016. We used [this incredibly helpful blog post from Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/10/22/how-to-make-a-true-color-landsat-8-image/?src=share) for instructions on how to process the image in Photoshop. 
* The **pipeline location at the Missouri River crossing** is from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers easement, available [here](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3461053/Easement.pdf) on page 14.
* The **entire pipeline route** is from Nitin Gadia’s [Bakken Pipeline Map](https://bakkenpipelinemap.com/) project, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nittyjee/bakkenpipelinemap).

Check out [this post](https://www.opennotebook.co/notebooks/16) for a peek behind the scenes at the process of making this map.

## Southern Ute oil and gas developments
### Data Sources
* **Natural gas pipelines** (interstate and intrastate) and **natural gas processing plants** are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s [energy mapping system](http://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.php). 
* **Oil and gas wells** are from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission’s wells database, available [here](http://cogcc.state.co.us/data2.html#/downloads)
* **Land ownership** data is from the Bureau of Land Management, available [here](https://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Programs/geographical_sciences/gis/GeospatialData.html)
* **Major roads** and **local roads** are from the Colorado Department of Transportation, available [here](http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/otis/catalog)

## Bears Ears National Monument and Utah land conflicts
### Data Sources
* **[Uranium mines and mills](https://gis.utah.gov/data/energy/uranium/)**, **[archaeological sites](https://gis.utah.gov/data/history/)**, **[land ownership](https://gis.utah.gov/data/sgid-cadastre/land-ownership/ )**, **[oil and gas wells](https://gis.utah.gov/data/energy/oil-gas/)** are all from the state of Utah’s [Automated Geographic Reference Center](https://gis.utah.gov/data/). Note that none of the active uranium permits are currently mining, but that could change if uranium prices increase. For archaeological sites, the state is divided into a hexagonal grid. Areas that are shaded have at least one known/documented archaeological site within that hexagon.
* The **Bears Ears National Monument boundaries** were provided by the Bureau of Land Management.
