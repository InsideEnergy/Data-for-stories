### What's in this folder?

This is the raw data used to make the map showing North Dakota communities with and without natural gas in the Inside Energy story [Filling In The Natural Gas Gaps](http://insideenergy.org/2017/04/06/filling-in-the-natural-gas-gaps/).

### Where does this data come from?

* North Dakota Public Service Commission -- The PSC maintains a list of cities with and without natural gas service, which were verified by looking at [MDU](https://www.montana-dakota.com/utility-menu/about-us/communities-served) and [Xcel Energy](https://www.xcelenergy.com/staticfiles/xe/Regulatory/Regulatory%20PDFs/rates/ND/Ng_Section_3.pdf)'s websites.
* [U.S. Census Bureau American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) -> Advanced Search -> Show Me All -> Geographies -> Place - 160 -> North Dakota -> All places within North Dakota -> Add To Your Selections -> Topics -> People -> Basic Count/Estimate -> Basic Count/Estimate -> Population Total -> TOTAL POPULATION in row with B01003 and 2015 ACS 5-year estimates
