### Data Dictionary

Describe the categories of the data, if they are not self-explanatory. Assume most are not, especially if you've had to do a calculation. This is where you explain any analysis you did. Such as, We divided `this-category` by `this-other-category` to get `this-third-percent-category`, the percent of something awesome. 

### Some Other Heading As Necessary

I've only done a few of these so far, so you may want to add some other kind of comments, depending on the data. Essentially, you should just think about doing everything possible to make our process and our analysis as transparent as possible.
