Coal production and employment data for the top five U.S. coal-producing states, 2001 to 2012.

## What's in this folder?
This is the raw data used for the Inside Energy story, ["IE Questions: In Wyoming, How Much Coal Does a Miner Mine?"](http://bit.ly/howmuchcoal)

## Data dictionary
The file, CoalProdEmp_2001_2012.csv, includes the fields geography (state name),  year (2001 to 2012), coal production (thousand short tons), average coal industry employees, and average coal production per employee in thousand short tons (calculated by dividing production by employment). Data is for the top five coal-producing states, Wyoming, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

The original source of the production and employment data is the Energy Information Administration's [Coal Data Browser](http://www.eia.gov/beta/coal/data/browser/). Inside Energy calculated production per employee from this data.
