# Crude Oil Prices and Oil & Gas Employment

Data for average monthly inflation-adjusted imported crude oil price for the United States, AND for monthly total seasonally-adjusted employment in oil and gas extraction in the U.S. Both series from January 1978 through May 2016.

### What's in this folder?

This is the raw data used in the Inside Energy story [IE Questions: Is A Petroleum Engineering Degree A Good Idea?]( http://insideenergy.org/2016/08/29/ie-questions-is-a-petroleum-engineering-degree-a-good-idea)

### Where does this data come from?

Source: [Energy Information Agency](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/realprices/) and [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CES1021100001).

In each case, you can change the data view to be monthly, and to stretch back to 1978.

### Data Notes

For both series, we've used seasonally adjusted data. In the case of crude oil prices, we use the inflation-adjusted price, or the "real" price, rather than the nominal price, so that we can meaningfully compare prices across time. In the case of employment, we use seasonally adjusted data, as calculated by the BLS. This accounts for normal, cyclical fluctuations in employment. 

### Data Caveat

In our video, we showed the two curves of these two series plotted in the same space. That's to illustrate that the curves loosely echo each other in their highs and lows. When we've presented them in more precise graph form, however, we haven't superimposed them. That's because the two series are measured in different units, and shouldn't be shown on the same scale. If you use this data, we don't recommend plotting both lines on one graph.
