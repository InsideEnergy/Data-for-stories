### Where does this data come from?

Source: [LIHEAP](https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/tables/FY2016/components.htm)

####Things to note:
*Our graph contains a hover feature that gives the exact numbers from this table. It also gives a short note for some states. That note comes from the data on LIHEAP's site - we simply edited the note in some cases for length and clarity.
*The `other` category includes administrative costs - states are allowed to spend 10 percent on admin expenses. Another 10 percent can be rolled over to the following year, and five percent can also go to what's called "[Assurance 16](https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/tables/FY2016/A16.htm)" funding, which can be used to educate about home energy conservation and for needs assessments and counseling.
