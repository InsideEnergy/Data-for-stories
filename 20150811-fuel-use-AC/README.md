### What's in this folder?

This is the raw data used in the Inside Energy story [IE Questions: Do I Use More Gas In My Car With My A/C On Or My Windows Down?](http://insideenergy.org/2015/08/11/ie-questions-do-i-use-more-gas-in-my-car-with-my-ac-on-or-my-windows-down)

### Where does this data come from?

Sources: [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/62232.pdf) and [U.S. Census](http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/maps/respop.html)

We used data listed in Figure 12 on page 5 of the report. According to one of the report's authors, John Rugh, NREL's calculations of total fuel use for A/C by state are based in part upon vehicle registration data from 2000. Because of this, in order to calculate per-capita fuel use, we used population data from the [U.S. Census](http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/maps/respop.html).
