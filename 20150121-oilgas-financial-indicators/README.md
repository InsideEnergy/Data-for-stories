### Data Dictionary

**Current Ratio**

*What it is:* Current assets divided by current liabilities.
*What is shows:* The ability to pay off immediate financial obligations. The higher the ratio, the more easily the company can pay.
*Simplified analogy:* The value of your checking account this month added to anything you could sell for cash this month, compared to all of the monthly bills you must pay.

**Debt-Equity Ratio**

*What it is:* Total liabilities divided by total shareholders’ equity.
*What is shows:* How leveraged a company is – that is, how much of its financing comes from debt rather than from shareholders. The higher the ratio, the more the company relies on debt to finance its operations. In general, a higher ratio is less concerning for a large and well-established company than it is for a small or new company.

**Interest Coverage Ratio**

*What it is:* Operating income divided by interest expenses.
*What it shows:* How burdened a company is by the costs of borrowing. The higher the ratio, the less we should worry about its ability to pay the interest on its debt.
*Simplified analogy:* Take the amount of money leftover after you pay rent, utilities, and groceries. Divide that by the amount of interest that you pay on your loans and credit cards. The more disposable income you have compared to the amount of interest you pay, the better your financial position overall.

**EBITDA**

*What it is:* Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
*What it shows:* A rough leveler used for comparison of companies’ profitability, focusing on operations and minimizing financing decisions and accounting practices. In general, bigger is better, but should be considered in conjunction with other measures, such as cash flow.

**Cash Flow from Operating Activities**

*What it is:* How much money the company generated in the reporting period as a result of running their business.
*What it shows:* The company’s ability to earn money, rather than just obtain money through financing their operations with investor money or loans.
*Simplified analogy:* The amount of money you make as a result of being employed.
