This repository contains the number of coal mineres employed in the top ten U.S. coal producing states from 2001 to 2014.

## What's in this repository?

This repository includes the data used for the graphics in the Inside Energy story, ["Wyoming Town Built On Coal Contemplates Its Future"](http://insideenergy.org/2015/08/17/wyoming-town-built-on-coal-contemplates-its-future/).

## Data dictionary

The data files *coal_employment_2001_2014.csv* and *coal_employment_2001_2014.xlsx* include the number of workers employed in the coal industry annually for the top ten coal producing states (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, Wyoming).

## Data Sources and Notes

The original source of the general coal data is the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which is accessed [here](http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment). 

Inside Energy queried using the NAICS code 2121 (coal mining). 

Note that 2014 data is preliminary. Data was not available for all states and all years, due to privacy concerns. In our graphic, we added a dotted line for Illinois when the data was not available. In the data tables, we used "--" to indicate unavailable data. Note that this does not mean no coal workers were employed in those states in those years.

BLS is not the only source that published data on coal employment. We compared this data, from the BLS, to [earlier data we had compiled](https://github.com/InsideEnergy/Data-for-stories/tree/master/20150428-coal-production-employment) from the Energy Information Administration, which is based on data from the Mining Safety and Health Administration, and found that the trends were the same.
